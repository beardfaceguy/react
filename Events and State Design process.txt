Events + State Design Process
1.  List out what a user will do and changes they will see while using your app
2.  Categorize each step as 'state' or 'event handler'
		User sees something on the screen change -> We probably need state to implement this step
		User committed some action -> We probably need an event handler to implement this.
3.  Group common steps.  Remove duplicates.  Rewrite descriptions

summary for 1, 2, and 3 above: 
	what state + event handlers are there?
	
	
	
4.  Look at mockup.  Remove or simplify parts that aren't changing.
5.  Replace remaining elements with text descriptions
6.  Repeat #4 and #5 with a different variation
7.  Imaging you have to write a function that returns the text of steps #5 and #6.  In addition to your component props, what other arguments would you need?

summary for 4-7 above:
	What name and type?
	
8.  Decide where each event handler + state will be defined.

summary for 8:
	Where's it defined?
	
	question to help answer 8 for the example of our Accordion component:
		Does any component besides Accordion reasonably need to know which item is expanded?
			Yes: Define in App
			No: Define in Accordion
	
	React isn't good at directly communicating data between siblings
	
	in the case of Accordion, defined in Accordion
	
	Define event handlers in the same location the state resides
