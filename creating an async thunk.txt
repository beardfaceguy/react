Creating an Async Thunk

1.  Create a new file for your thunk.  Name it after the purpose of the request
2.  Create the thunk.  Give it a base type that describes the purpose of the request
3.  In the thunk, make the request, return the data that you want to use in the reducer
4.  In the slice, add extraReducers, watching for the action types made by the thunk
